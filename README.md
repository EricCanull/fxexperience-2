This is an updated repo to the original fxexperience created by
Jasper Potts. Originally meant to coincide with the fxexperience 
blog.  It contains several tools which allow for quick CSS 
automation by modifying the JavaFX default Caspian theme and 
also visualizing animations and generating the code.
